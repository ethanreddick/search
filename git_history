    Addressed edge case where no results are returned from the database, the user is now aware there are no results instead of waiting under the impression it is loading.

    Fixed pagination controls, pagination implementation, limited results to 20 per page, and fixed highlighting when hovering over elements. Still a bug to fix where that part doesn't work until you click out of and then back into the search engine's window though.

    Connected GUI to the database, and took care of some basic formatting for the results that are returned. Will have to switch to a different solution instead of 'QTextEdit' to implement the functionality for the user to be able to click on their desired result and open it in the browser.

    Fixed a bug where sometimes when the script was quit the bloom_filter saving process would be interrupted resulting in a corrupted bloom_filter.pkl file. The fix involves saving to a temp file and then once saving is complete then replacing the old file with the new one. If the saving process is messed up somehow the new temp file is simply discarded.

    Added more evalutate_site_quality restrictions including: site needs to be in english, have no unknown characters, and not contain any '#' symbols in the URL. I also introduced the logging module so I can control what level of warnings/errors are printed to the console.

    Implemented the use of a .csv file containing the top 1 million URLs that feeds the program, and only subdomains of those top-level domains are whitelisted. I moved a lot of the processing from the main method into the scrape_page function due to this change. Next job is to introduce concurrency to scale up this operation.

    Working on a from-the-ground-up rebuild of the webcrawler completely reimagined and with no copy+paste from chatGPT. This first commit has the basic web-crawler functionality and is working with a postgreSQL database. It visits a site and stores the URL, title, headers, and all other links on the page and repeats with the links it gathered.

    Web scraper now skips sites with a basic whitelist/blacklist approach, and it saves successfully to the adjacency matrix while it runs.
